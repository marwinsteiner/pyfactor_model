# Factor Model for Portfolio Construction

## Introduction

This project aims to implement a factor model for portfolio construction using Python. Factor models are powerful tools
in quantitative finance, used to explain asset returns and construct efficient portfolios. By decomposing asset returns
into common factors and idiosyncratic components, we can gain insights into the drivers of portfolio performance and
optimize asset allocation.

## Theoretical Background

Factor models are based on the idea that asset returns can be explained by a set of common factors. The most basic form
of a factor model is the single-factor model, often represented by the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). However, for
this project, we'll focus on a multi-factor model, which provides a more comprehensive view of asset behavior.

### Multi-Factor Model

The multi-factor model can be expressed as:

$$R_i = \alpha_i + \beta_{i1}F_1 + \beta_{i2}F_2 + ... + \beta_{iK}F_K + \epsilon_i$$

Where:

- $$R_i$$ is the return of asset $$i$$
- $$\alpha_i$$ is the asset's excess return (unexplained by the factors)
- $$\beta_{ij}$$ is the sensitivity of asset $$i$$ to factor $$j$$
- $$F_j$$ is the return of factor $$j$$
- $$\epsilon_i$$ is the idiosyncratic return (specific to asset $$i$$)
- $$K$$ is the number of factors

Common factors in financial models often include:

1. Market factor
2. Size factor (SMB - Small Minus Big)
3. Value factor (HML - High Minus Low)
4. Momentum factor
5. Quality factor

### Portfolio Construction

Using the factor model, we can construct portfolios by optimizing the exposure to desired factors while minimizing
idiosyncratic risk. The portfolio optimization problem can be formulated as:

$$\text{maximize } \quad \mu_p = w^T\mu
\text{subject to } \quad \sigma_p^2 = w^T\Sigma w \leq \sigma_{target}^2
\qquad\qquad\quad w^T\mathbf{1} = 1
\qquad\qquad\quad w_i \geq 0 \quad \forall i$$

Where:

- $$w$$ is the vector of portfolio weights
- $$\mu$$ is the vector of expected returns
- $$\Sigma$$ is the covariance matrix of returns
- $$\sigma_{target}^2$$ is the target portfolio variance

## Project Objectives

1. Implement a multi-factor model using Python
2. Estimate factor exposures ($\beta$) for a set of assets
3. Construct an optimized portfolio based on the factor model
4. Evaluate the performance of the factor-based portfolio
5. Provide clear documentation and visualizations of the results

By completing this project, we aim to demonstrate the practical application of factor models in portfolio construction
and showcase the power of Python in quantitative finance.
